# Crowd-Monitoring
Crowd Monitoring using YOLOv8 and OpenCV

This project aims to leverage the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for real
time object detection in retail stores to analyze customer behavior, optimize 
store layouts, and make data-driven decisions to enhance customer experience 
and increase revenue. Traditional methods of data collection and analysis in 
retail stores often lack real-time capabilities, making it challenging for businesses 
to respond promptly to customer needs and preferences. By implementing the 
YOLO algorithm, this project seeks to overcome these challenges by providing 
businesses with real-time insights into customer behavior and store layout 
optimization. The project will involve the development of a prototype system 
that utilizes YOLO for object detection, tracking, and analysis, and demonstrate 
its effectiveness in enhancing customer experience and driving business growth.
